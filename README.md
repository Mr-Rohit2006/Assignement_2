Even or Odd Number Checker

Description

This Python script determines whether a given number is even or odd.

How It Works

The script prompts the user to enter an integer.
It checks whether the number is divisible by 2.
If the number is divisible by 2, it prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.

Usage

Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter an integer when prompted.
The script will display whether the number is even or odd.

Example Output

Enter a number: 4
4 is an even number.

Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Notes

The program checks the remainder when the number is divided by 2 (a % 2).
Ensure the input is a valid integer to avoid errors.
Modify the script to handle input errors if necessary.

Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

Description

This Python script calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using a loop.

How It Works

The script initializes a variable sum to 0.
It iterates over numbers from 0 to 50 using a for loop.
Each number is added to sum during iteration.
Finally, the script prints the total sum.

Usage

Run the script in a Python environment.
The script will calculate and display the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.

Example Output

The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275

Requirements

Python 3.x

Notes

The loop runs from 0 to 50, which includes 0 in the sum calculation. If the sum should start from 1, modify the range to range(1, 51).
The variable i is used for iteration but is not needed outside the loop.
